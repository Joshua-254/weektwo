	<p>
		This is a web application built using HTML,Javascript and CSS, that takes a user's birthday,gender and calculates the day of the week they were born and then depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name.<br>
		
		Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.<br>
		
		<b><i>Most people do know when their birthdays are</i></b>, but some might not know what day of the week they were born. Luckily for us, there are ways to calculate the day of the week from a specific date.<br>
		
		<b><p style="color:green;">Well,no need to worry because the solution is here.</p></b>
